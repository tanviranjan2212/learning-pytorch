# Projects with Deep Learning

This project consists of my adventure into various projects where I advance from traditional ML techniques (like regression, SVM, Random Forest) to more Deep Learning techniques (like MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM). Following is the list of all projects on here:

1. Predicting whether or not a tweet is about a disaster ([Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview))
    * SVMs show the best test performance (even more than a traditional MLP)
    * TODO: Try LSTM or RNN that are more suited for text processing

2. Time series analysis
