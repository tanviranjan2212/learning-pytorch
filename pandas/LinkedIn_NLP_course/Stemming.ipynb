    "\n",
    "* Stemming is converting a word to it's root, eg, reducing stemming to stem.\n",
    "There are 4 types of stemmers included in the nltk library, we'll use Porter Stemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lemmatizing is grouping together inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single term, identified by the word's lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Both stemming and lemmatizing are similar as they reduce a word to its root. But they are different in the way they are implemented. Stemming usually involves chopping down end letters, so its simple but may or may not return a meaningful word. Lemmatizing uses more context and always returns a meaningful word\n",
